# ðŸŽ¬ MoviesApp

Welcome to **MoviesApp** â€“ a simple SwiftUI-based movie browser built using modern Swift Concurrency and MVVM+C architecture.

This app fetches and displays movie data from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) using their public API.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the app on your machine after cloning the repo ```git@github.com:joliejuly/MoviesApp.git```:

1.	**Create your Access Token**:
Youâ€™ll need a TMDb access token to fetch movie data. You can get one for free by creating an account at TMDb and generating a personal API token.

2.	**Create your Secrets.xcconfig file**:

In the root of the project (alongside SecretsExample.xcconfig), create a file called ```Secrets.xcconfig```. You can copy ```SecretsExample.xcconfig``` that is commited to the repo.
Make sure it contains ```TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN = <YOUR_TMDB_TOKEN_HERE>``` line.

Alternatively, you can just paste your token in ```Auth -> Bundle+Extension.swift``` file under ```var tmdbAccessToken``` value.
