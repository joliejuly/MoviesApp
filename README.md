# 🎬 MoviesApp

Welcome to **MoviesApp** – a simple SwiftUI-based movie browser built using modern Swift Concurrency and MVVM+C architecture.

This app fetches and displays movie data from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) using their public API.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the app on your machine, clone the repo ```git@github.com:joliejuly/MoviesApp.git```. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If you have a ```Secrets.xcconfig``` file provided by me, just drag it to the root of the project and run.**


If you don't have a ```Secrets.xcconfig``` file, you can create your own in 2 simple steps: 

1.	**Create your Access Token**:
You’ll need a TMDb access token to fetch movie data. You can get one for free by creating an account at TMDb and generating a personal API token.

2.	**Create your Secrets.xcconfig file**:

In the root of the project (alongside SecretsExample.xcconfig), create a file called ```Secrets.xcconfig```. You can copy ```SecretsExample.xcconfig``` that is commited to the repo.
Make sure it contains ```TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN = <YOUR_TMDB_TOKEN_HERE>``` line.

Alternatively, you can just paste your token in ```Auth -> Bundle+Extension.swift``` file under ```var tmdbAccessToken``` value.

## 📱 Why this project uses the [swift‐dependencies](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies) package as the only 3rd party library

Dependency management is the only cross-cutting concern in this codebase that isn’t already handled well by the standard library or SwiftUI. I chose [swift-dependencies](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies) as the single third-party package because it solves that problem cleanly while keeping the overall solution simple and test-friendly. 

**Key points**:
- Eliminates boiler-plate. Without a helper the same “pass this service down the chain” code would repeat in every view and view-model initializer. The package replaces that with one @Dependency line per use site, so the domain logic stays readable.
- Testability built in. Unit tests can swap concrete implementations with the one-liner
```withDependencies```, which is dramatically shorter and less error-prone than re-creating the object graph by hand.
- Lazy and cached by default. Each service is constructed only on first access and then reused, so start-up work stays near zero even as the feature set grows.
- Actively maintained and MIT-licensed. It is written by the authors of The Composable Architecture and widely used in production apps.


## 📱 To be implemented: 

  - Localization
  - More details and nicer UI for Movie details
