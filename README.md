# ðŸŽ¬ MoviesApp

Welcome to **MoviesApp** â€“ a simple SwiftUI-based movie browser built using modern Swift Concurrency and MVVM architecture.

This app fetches and displays movie data from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) using their public API.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the app on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MoviesApp.git
   cd MoviesApp

2.	**Install dependencies**:

This project uses Swift Package Manager for Swift-Dependencies and Swift-Collections â€“ just open the project in Xcode and it should fetch everything automatically.

4.	**Create your Access Token**:
Youâ€™ll need a TMDb access token to fetch movie data. You can get one for free by creating an account at TMDb and generating a personal API token.

6.	**Create your Secrets.xcconfig file**:

In the root of your project (or alongside your existing .xcconfig files), create a file called ```Secrets.xcconfig```. You can copy ```SecretsExample.xcconfig``` that is commited to the repo.
Make sure it contains ```TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN = <YOUR_TMDB_TOKEN_HERE>``` line.

Alternatively, you can just paste your token in ```Auth -> Bundle+Extension.swift``` file under ```var tmdbAccessToken``` value.
